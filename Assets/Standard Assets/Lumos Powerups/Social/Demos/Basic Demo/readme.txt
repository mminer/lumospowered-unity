 --- Lumos Social Demo (Basic) ---
 
 Overview:
 Look at LumosSocialDemoBasic.cs to learn how to award achievements and record 
 high scores to leaderboards.
 
 Look at the code in the Social/GUI folder to see how you could potentially 
 display achievements, leaderboards, user information, and more.
 
 1. The Basics
 LumosSocialDemoBasic.cs demonstrates common functionality you are most likely 
 interested in. This script is not used in the demo at all, and soley exists 
 as bonus documentation for you to check out.
 
 2. Using LumosSocialGUI
 When you run this demo it will use LumosSocialDemoBasicGUI.cs to show off 
 how to use the built-in LumosSocialGUI class. 
 
 The LumosSocialGUI class exists as an example for developers. We do not 
 intend for you to use it as-is in your final product. You will at least 
 want to change the GUI skin to make it look nice. In many cases you will want 
 to use a simpler login/registration approach too. If you do, please look at 
 the Custom Login Demo as  well.

Powerups
---------------

If you are trying to use a powerup but nothing is happening, it's possible 
a component was not added or was accidentally removed from the Lumos 
GameObject.

You can fix this by openening Unity's preferences, go to the Lumos panel, and
click the "Run Setup Scripts" button. This will attempt to add any missing
components to the Lumos prefab.

Lumos Game Analytics
====================

Lumos tracks player engagement and performance of your game. With drag-and-drop
ease, record custom events, track your player's system specs(operating system,
RAM, etc.), remotely view errors and warnings that are thrown at runtime, and
solicit feedback from players in-game.

Current version: 0.9.1


Getting Started
---------------

To obtain your secret key, visit http://www.uselumos.com/ and sign in with your
Google account. Add a new game from the Games page and you will be directed to
your new game's settings tab. From here copy your secret key.

In Unity, choose GameObject > Create Other > Lumos... You will be prompted to
enter your secret key. Once the Lumos game object is in the scene you are done;
once your game is deployed stats from each play session will be recorded. We
recommended that you place Lumos in the first scene that your game loads. It is
unneccessary to have the Lumos game object present in every scene.

Flash Support
-------------

Due to a number of classes missing from Unity's Flash export, Lumos is
currently unsupported on this platform. We hope this is remedied in the future,
but for the time being the functionality provided by Lumos is simply
unavailable in Flash games.

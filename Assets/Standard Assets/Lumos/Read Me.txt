Adding Powerups
---------------

If you installed Lumos and later subscribe to a new powerup, please check 
the new powerup's documentation page for instructions. In some cases there 
may be scripts that you need to attach to the Lumos GameObject.

Alternatively you can open Unity's preferences, go to the Lumos panel, and 
click the "Run Setup Scripts" button. This will attempt to add any missing 
components to the Lumos prefab.
